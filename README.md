## Overview

`monster-ugi` is a fairy chess engine wrapper written in Rust for engines written using the `monster-chess` move generation library. It easily allows you to expose an API for your engine, and connect it to one of the **UCI**, **UAI**, or **UGI** protocols. It primarily aims for your engine to be compatible with [cutegames](https://github.com/kz04px/cutegames).
